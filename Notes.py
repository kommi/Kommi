	def UntouchabilityMain:
		# SARI: Social Attitudinal Research for India- Survey
		Untouchability exists more than we believe- In different forms: Seperate glass for Maids
			Children Attitudes
			Educating Children than denying existence of untouchability
			#US: Children read both accomplishments and discrimination faced by Blacks displayed less biased attitudes than those who only read accomplishments
			# Mothers: Primary, Early influencers #Women change agents

		Unconstitutional- 2 Lakhs still present in 21st century Yet no police complaint registered in country. #Law Implementation
	def ReservationsMain:
		#PSIR:
		Reasons:
			Equality tool: To level historical inequalities and injustice
		Reasons for opposition:
			Merit:
				Merit is not just test based answers alone
				Having reached school, Job qualification despite economic, social hardships- Ability to perform in hardships- Merit?
			Equality:
				Provision is for equality not against equality
				Treating unequals equally is not equality
				Level playing field needed: Historical inequalities, Parental background, No caste based network, Systemic discrimination
				Access to Education, Jobs, Training etc.
				May require generations to imbibe such culture, self confidence among backward castes
			Hard work:
				Test marks or Test marks despite discrimation and disadvantages?
			Income:
				Reservations are not only anti-poverty measures
				Social Stigma is real even with higher income: Dalit Legislators, Higher officers facing discrimination
					Blatant misuse of SC/ST act is also present
				Poor in general category may not face caste discrimination like Dalits do
			Not needed anymore:
				Indicators says otherwise
			Rich Dalit gets it:
				Need to look at it.
def TribalsMain:
	Development and Tribals
		Niyamgiri - Kondhs- Vedanta
	def BITMain:
		AP vs Ras Al Khaimah - Bauxite mining cancellation- RAK dragged govt to ITA (Investemnt Treaty Arbitration)
		Problems:
			Govt dragged to courts by MNC's under BITs
			Foreign investors- Additional to Domestic laws protection from BIT
			1. Govt backtracking from political, tribal pressures : Ras Al Khaimah case
			2. Judiciary cancelling permits - Vedanta case
		Why?
		1. No provision to protect tribals in Old or new 2015 model BITs
		UN says:
			Failure to address HR of indigenous people in BITs
			Perceived Threat from ITA for Enforcement and  implementation?
			Exclusion of Indigenous People involvement in Policy making process
		Govts seeing Tribals as impediments for development: Jharkhand, Chattisgarh competing for MOU's
		#Role of state changing vis a vis Tribals preferring economic growth #RoleofState #PSIR
	Wayforward:
		incorporate into BITs
		Attitude of states
		Involvement of tribals in policy making
		Effective enforcement of domestic laws
	Safegaurds for Tribals:
		Free, Prior and Informed consent mandatory
		5th and 6th Schedules

	Dowry
	Exclusion from public spaces:
		Women accompanied to shopping, doctors
		Sick children brought to doctor late- Had to wait till husband come home
	Violence
		Last to eat, Less to Eat, Less likely to survive infancy, If they do- Less likely to get education- To work outside- 
		To take imp decisions of her own life- Leave about decision in family, LL to have Bank account.
		Conflict - POSCO and Sec 375 IPC (Rape): POSCO- special provisions for sexual assaults on minors <18 years; 375- If victim is married -Child marriage no problem
			SC asked to correct it #Old and conflicting laws
		SHWWMain: Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibhition, Redressal) "address question with PPR measures"
			From Vishaka guidelines: SC- Eliminate all forms of discrimination and ensure safety and security to women
		Reasons:
			Mindsets
			Weak implementation
			Influence
			Stigma
			Difficult to prove
		Wayforward:
			Mindset change: How we raise our children and Sons
				Talking about the problem openly
				Support victims
				# Curb Social trauma for complaining, Social stigma attached- Who will marry her?
			Implementation of laws: DoPT circular - 30 days for completion of investigation after complaint- max 90 days
				Same in CrPC- if not completed accused can get bail
			Fear of law: weakened by influence, Money and Muscle
			Punishment for false charges
			ICC Internal Complaints Committee >10 employees- Many companies have no ICC's-
			Time bar for complaint: No complaint for rape happened 3 years ago!
			DoPT and MWCD: Min of Women and Child Development: Instill gender sensitivity, awareness programs
	Mindsets:
		Men protesting about misuse of laws!? 
			Nirbhaya, Domestic Violence Act- speaking from a previliged position? #getmain
		Make men part of these initiatives and dialogues

		50% Anemic: Reasons?
		Low weight of Mother- Impact on children
			40% Children Stunted:
				Reasons:
				Mother Health, Weight
				Breast feeding
				Nutrition
				Sanitation- Diseases -> Stunting
			Golden 2 years: Long lasting impact: Health, Education : Overall quality of Human resource #Demographic Dividend
	def LaborForceParticipationMain:
		Declining in India
		Reasons:
			High income- No for hards tasks
			Fragmentation of Agriculture: Less Agriculture jobs
			MNREGA: Women High, 45% of women first time to wage labor- Shows it is an access problem not choice
		India lowest : Nepal, CMLV countries doing better : Why?
		Access:
			Non agricultural employment options
			Road network: Villages with roads has higher participation- Jobs in closest towns
			Work culture: Parenting friendly, Crutches, Maternity benefits
			Social: Nuclear families- Women dropping out to take care of children; Sacrifice for children
			Commute burden, American work culture (More hours) -> Parenting burden
				Need work life balance- Scandavanian countries model
				Sharing parenting burden : Maternity bill no paternal leaves
		Importance:
			ES 2016-17 : Demographic dividend is already receding
			Quick actions to fill gap with east asian counterparts

		NFFP: National Family Planning Program
			RMNCH+A strategy: Reproductive Maternal Newborn, Child, #Adoloscent Health (Not Adult) #News
 		Children raising is costly everyone wants (Even rural) fewer children but why?
		Reasons:
		Survival of children: Life expectancy not great in certain pockets. -Health access
		Economic dependency on labor
		Less or No negotiating power within family: Women exclusion in decision making
		Contraceptive: Awareness, Availability
		Injectable contraceptive: DMPA: Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate. 3 months effect
		Pros: Boquet increased- Diversifying choice- 75% dependent on Female sterilization #+ve correlation bwn choices and willingness
		Cons: Poor sterilization cases (Bilaspur 13 women death), HIV, Stocking, Irregular use- Missinh 3 months :P, Focus on women! :(, ANM training
		Wayforward:

			His- for both
			I am a Hindu and You are Hindus and hence vote for me : Wrong
			You as Hindus you know I can alone defend your interests better: Now wrong

			His only to candidate
		More Questions:
			Can the state prevent adults to be exposed to such ideas?
			Can a court decide only certain interests counts in democracy?
			Does Secularism mandates complete exclusion of religion from public sphere?
			All these are necessarily evil markers?
			Is it wrong to citizens to organize on these grounds to seek liberation through gaining political power?

	1st principle : Each person is equally entitled to basic liberties and rights
	2nd principle: Difference principle: Inequalities are legitimate as long as they are designed to yield max benefit for least advantaged members
	1st enjoys priority over 2nd
	
	Original Position: Pre political abstraction from reality in which a group of people know nothing about themselves (Age, names, gender etc.) [VEIL OF IGNORANCE] are asked about
	To choose principles of justice that could serve as standard constitution laws and adjudication mechanisms
		The most rational choices under such veil of ignorance would result in equal rights and liberties for all;
			Equality of education and employment opportunities
			Guranteed minimum means

	Nehru: All of us, to whatever religion we may belong are equally the children of India with equal rights, previliges and obligations.
	Citizens can neither demand state completely out of religion nor that it arbitrarily involves in each aspect of it -Rajeev Bhargava

	INC:
		INM party- Got its attributes
		Multi Ethnic coalitions
		Internal Federalization
		Reflected Social Cleavages
	INC decline:
		1971- Delinking of Parliament and State elections
			Scope of regional parties to take on INC on state specific issues
		Centralization of Power: Supreme leader and weak regional leaders except few- CM appointed by High Command
	Paradoxes:
		Women at helm: Sonia, Mamata but scant in ground level
		Parties for democracy but No internal party democracy
		UP: Dalit- Brahmin coalitions, BJP-PDP coalitions- Power trumps Ideologies, Dalit-Muslim
		Secularism: All parties subscibe they are secular- But riots has party's role
		Fringe Politics: Sakshi Maharaj, Yogi Adityanath embarrassing remarks attention away from Development agenda
	Fringe Politics:
		Lack of inner party democracy: Impacts career prospects in highly centralized parties
			Noise or disturbance to get attention of top
			Less ownership -less responsible -> Disconnect what larger interests of party
		Dynastic politics, Major contendors- Rich or political families.
		No structural advancement prospects from doing good work
	BJP as Hegemonparty?

		Delimitation struck in 1971
		InterStateCouncil, Zonal Councils
	Steps taken:
		CSS schemes:
		Tribal Development Program, Hill area development program
		Small states
		Special status
	Can we leave inequality to markets and local governments?
		Markets?
		Local Governments:
			Good but not always- Especially when society is highly unequal and systemic discrimination exists: Caste system in India
	Oxfam report:
		8 Richest people own ~ 5wealth of rest 50% population
		India- 1% holds 58% Indian population
		Reports pn 1% wealth increasing at the expense of 99%
		HDR: 27% loss in HDI score due to various forms of inequality
	Inequalities and challenge to democracy
		Aristotle: Democracy
			Rich and poor are equal in one dimension -Right to vote
			Poor: Would always be for removing this inequality -> Confiscation and redistribution of wealth
			Rich: Would always be for protecting inequalities in all dimensions
		To address this inevitable class confrontation: Class warfare constitutions
		Class warfare constitutions: Tiered classes, Rich houses vs Lower houses
		Machiavelli: Perfect republic, Patrician and Plebian divisions #getmain
		Guilds, Caste, Community etc. tiered representations in royal courts
		Post rise of Republics -> Upper and lower houses
	Case of USA: Middle class constitution
		Wide land- Majority belonging to new land are middleclass
		Started on a fairly egalitarian slate
		No barriers: Rich can be part of lower house, poor in upper house
		Functions well when inequalities are less and chance for self improvement is open
	Regional inequalities:
		Pace of liberalization reforms. Land reforms
	Impact of inequalities:
		Wealthy: 
			Not only vote- can influence- Donations, Media
			Money power in politics
		Taxation: Can afford loopholes, Tax consultants- Heavy indirect tax collections in India
		Rights: Legal costs favor wealthy
		Facilties: Market catering for heavy users- Loyalty: Cheaper per mile for rich than middle class
			Poor can never use roads as much as rich?

		# # Not accountable for decisions made unlike Executive: Dangerous for Polity
		Seperation of powers at risk
		Overreach into Executive and Legislative domains
		Impacts Governance, Economic Growth
		Hurts Public confidence on Executive and Legislature- Puts them in bad light?

			Legislative Vaccum
			BCCI reluctance to reform -> SC strong stand
			BCCI- Best run sports body
			# Judiciary domain? Overhaul? Capability? No Accountability to SC if reforms fail
				Finances
				Sports Knowledge
				Understanding how things works- Time tested
			If SC can overhaul BCCI- Where will it stop? Sports bodies? What if this activism extends to CAG, EC etc.?
			#Removal of BCCI- Presi- Anurag Thakur- Does SC has such power?
			#Sports Governance
			#FIFA overhaul
				Votes to smaller countries?
			#Sports Ministry Chastisising IOA- Appointements

		Diversity in expression of views whether in writing, visual encourages debate. debate should never be shut out. I AM RIGHT DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE WRONG
		Our culture breeds tolerance both in thoughts and action.

		#Leadership #UNSECMembership
	Roots:
		West thought IS can act as bargaining chip for Assad's ouster but now

		NO:
			Profit driven
			Assymetric power: Doctor huge power/ Knowledge compared to Patient- In knowing rights, Consumer protection
			Loose regulation and enforcement
			Poor Insurance Coverage:
		Wayforward:
			100% Insurance Cover and Rationalization of Charges
			E-HealthRecords: EHR's: Effective Insurance risk pooling => Let Insurance market competition regulate private healthcare
			Competition -> Lesser Premiums -> Technology help to identify ->Unnecessary medications, Diagnosis etc. (Atleast blatant fraud)?

	Wayforward:
		Multiple investigations by WHO, other done but couldn't identify reason
		Facilitate further collobaration at International level- Funds
		Dialysis centers, Kidney Nurse staff
		Support to families - Many being poor
		Continuous surveillance Disease monitoring in place: Helps data analytics-
		Inter Disciplinary approach: + Sociologists etc. Karnataka- Only Male children deaths not girls- Milk boiled in a vessel(Metal is a culprit)- Girls not given milk- became boon for them.

	Govt order: Prescribe generics, Legibly, in Capitals- Promote generics usage:
		OOP expenses very high in India- Generics must be used as  generics powerhouse country
	Doctors too powerful- Knowledge assymetry- Medical culture in India- No questioning of Doctor
	Steps:
		Jan aushadi stores
		MCI guidelines
	Cons:
		Doctors reluctance: Incentives offered by pharma companies
		Pharma industry
	Wayforward:
		More Janaushadi stores

		Apps suggesting Generics
		Pharmacists know-how- poor: Should be able to suggest
		only 1% generics undergo proper testing	
			Strict quality process
			More drug inspectors

	SC: Aadhar not mandatory for welfare schemes- Benefits can't be denied but Govt free to make it necessary for non welfare transactions like PAN, IT returns, Bank account etc.
	Mass Surveillance vs Targeted Surveillance:
	Intended use as of today
	Use in future, by whom? Risks
	Risks:
		Foreign Govts, Terrorsits, Criminals getting biometrics
		No Consent: Biometric data can be used without consent- Dead, Unconscious unlike smart card based authentication- where PIN has to be memorized.
		ID theft
		Fraud, Misrepresentation
	Risks of centralized database:
	Mitigation:
		Minimal set of informaiton to establish identity: Name, Age, Gender, Address
		Database not downloadable or searchable
		Random number without knowledge: Cannot infer anything from number
		Only YES or NO response to the transaction authentication
		Transaction purpose not recorded: Only logs maintained will be with service provider. : But with bigdata analytics timestamps etc. No difficult to get purpose.
		Lock facility : Disable authentication for a period of time.
		
	Benefits:
		Targeted delivery: Plugging leakages
		
	Concerns:
		No privacy and Data sharing law?
			But we are sharing biometrics for Passport, Voter Identity card already? 
		Risk of Police state and Surveillance?
	Does KYC really help?
		Developed countries no KYC for SIM cards- KYC haven't stopped usage of SIM cards by terrorists and criminals in India

def PoullutionMain:
	Causes:
	Steps:
		Odd Even
		Ban on Disel Vehicles
		Bharat 6 by 2020
		Fleet Modernization Scheme
		No entry for non destinied vehicles into Delhi
	Long term:
		Urban Planning - 
			Less commute time
			Gated communities -> Pedestrian paths should be allowed
			Preplan outskirt areas
		Traffic : Less elevated roads (2X pollution), Less Signals
		Walking and Cycline friendly cities
		Car costs: Green taxes, parking charges raise, Congestion taxes
		Efficient public transport: JNNURM busses, CNG stations, Mass Rapid Transit Systems, Buslanes
			Last mile connectivity, Safety
		Data gathering: Air Quality Index, SBS survey
	#Training compulsory to Truck and Bus drivers on fuel efficiency
	def BSIVShiftMain:
		SC: No sale of BSIII post March 31st
			People health is important than any industries commercial interests.
		Auto fuel policy
		#One India One Fuel
		Issues:
		BSII to BS III shift -deadlines stretched for months.
		Policy laid deadline before 2 years.
		Center assurances created some confusion.
		Verdict: Allowing no relaxation- important for BSIV to BS VI leapfrogging  by 2020
		
		Inventory clearances: Export, Upgrade
		Ensure quality fuel -so catalytic converters are not damaged
		50-60% pollution is from vehicles aged >10 years
		
		Short term relief. As percapita income increases number of new vehicles is going to offset any gains from technology upgrades.
		
	def CPCBWHODisagreementMain:
		CPCB: WHO 10/20 world's most polluted cities in India is wrong
		Why?
			No PM 2.5 level monitors- WHO used conversion factors from PM 10 to measure PM 2.5 (Incorrect factors)
			Weather fluctuations- Foreign simulation models extrapolated
			No certification agency for PM 2.5 Monitors in India
	def IndoorPollutionMain:
		PMUY: PM Ujjwala Yojana- Target of 1.5 Cr LPG connections achieved, 70% Coverage
			#Women Empowerement #Health #UNFCCC
Ganga Yamuna as legal persons: by Uttarakhand HC
	Appointed Director Namami Gange, CS of Uttarakhand, Advocate Gen of Uttarakhand as advocates for river
	Right to be sued or Right to sue.?
	
Allahabad HC ruled Rama Lalla as a legal person
def GHGMain:
	Inland ponds: Loses CO2 absorption capacity while increased Methane output after temp rise
	Soil: Increased CO2 output initially but tapers off later
	40% of methane output from inland waters ( CH4 = 28X CO2 GHG potential)

	#Reduction in emissions by efficiency, saving measures much easy and less costly compared to renewables
	Govt: Envi Ministry to prescribe temperature limits- like Japan: 28 C in summer
		Helps in HCFC- Kigali agreement
		Change of Tech, Skill needed, Employment
		Emerging markets : Huge growth for refrigeration and AC's
	
def WASHMAIN: Water, Sanitation, Hygiene

		Segmentation:
		GSS: Geographical and Social Context - Urban, Rural, Backward etc.
		LCS: Life Cycle Segmentation : Children, Women, Old etc.

def WaterMain: #VVIMPMAINS
	WWDR: World Water Development Report by UNWDP: UN Water Development Program
	SDG 6: Water and sanitation
	2/3rds of India- Hard rock layer =Very slow ground water recharge
	Waste water: current Flushed and forgetten
		A resource- Nutrients, Salt, Nitrogen, Energy, Water
		80% in world and 95% in LDC, APEC waste water untreated- WWDR
		1$ spent on waste water = 5.5$ benefits
	How?
		Socio economic factors: Disadvantaged to face burnt most likely
		Health: Cholera, Dyssentry etc, Vector borne diseases
		Minimize pollution maximize 3R
		in SE Asia revenues paid off from fertilizers recovered?
		Water scarcity huge: APEC, India, China
			Lack of water -> Forced to use unhygenic sources
		Singapore Example:
			#Newater supplies 30% of singapore: Industry use main
		Greater support from Municipalities, Local bodies
			Lack of financial, human resources
			Enforcement of laws: dumping, toxins
	Water Recharge:
		Sandmining
		Deforestation
	#Privatization of Water?
	Water is just not a commodity
	Involves:
		Best sourcing
		Processing
		Distributing
		Optimal Usage
		Collecting Sweage
		Maintaining whole infrastructure
	World Trend: Privatization of water restricted to areas like distribution- even there not sustainable for long- Trend =Re muncipalization of water
	Private works on bottom line maximization profits. Might lead to exploitation of water for profits
	#Ground water already private
	Wayforward:
		Neither privatization nor Governemnt : #Trusteeship needed

		Public Hearings: Successful in drawing attention
			Open discussions -> Better decisions, Awareness of risks involved
			Govt- Ground for Consent
		Risks: Cynicism
		Compliance Gap: #Once approved utter disrespect to agreement: Dumping flyash etc.
			Not transparent: Only between Govt and Project Builder -Community / Third Party less inovlved
			Data Not in public: Cites resource crunch

		Small fires Indigenous knowledge before peak seasons better than catastrophes in peak seasons
